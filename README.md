Tools for programmatically interfacing with the ICSD, Mindat, and other databases of experimental materials, minerals, etc.

**Authors:** Aaron Kaplan (Materials Project, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory)

`xtalxd` is a namespace package which includes both a client for accessing the ICSD API, Mindat API, and an analysis package for manipulating derived data.
The analysis tools importantly include checks on CIF fidelity for downstream study with electronic structure methods.
